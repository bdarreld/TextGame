## About
TextGame is an experimental project aimed at refining my game development skills, with a focus on crafting engaging game mechanics, efficient program packaging, and other key aspects of game design.
<br><br>
The game features a 2D top-down view and is playable directly from any systemâ€™s built-in terminal. Players navigate a grid-based map, encountering various obstacles like walls and enemies. The objective is simple: reach the goal and win.

  W - Move up <br/>
  A - Move left <br/>
  S - Move down <br/>
  D - Move right <br/>
  CTRL - Toggle portal teleporting <br/>
  CTRL+Q - Quit game <br/>
