## About
TextGame is an experimental project built and developed to hone my skills in game development, including dynamic and exciting game mechanics, program packaging, and more.
<br/><br/>
TextGame is a 2D top-down game which uses any system's built-in terminal to play. The player is placed on a grid-like map with obstacles, including walls and enemies. The objective of the game is to get to the goal and win.

## Game controls
  W - Move up <br/>
  A - Move left <br/>
  S - Move down <br/>
  D - Move right <br/>
  CTRL - Toggle portal teleporting <br/>
  CTRL+Q - Quit game <br/>

## Requirements

## Quick Start (For Players)
1. Download `TextGame.zip` from the [Releases](../../releases) page
